For centuries the members of the tribe, who live deep within the rainforest, had relied on this oil to nourish their hair and skin.<\/p><p>The women gave Fabian one bottle of rahua oil, which he carefully transported back to New York in his suitcase. In his salon on Fifth Avenue, he decided—as an experiment, and without any expectations—to use the oil as a treatment for a client with extremely dry, damaged hair. After 10 minutes, her hair was completely transformed: from brittle and lifeless to healthy, shiny, and bouncy. Fabian was as shocked as his client. Here was solid proof that this ingredient, used for centuries, produced tangible results.<\/p><p>Fabian knew he had something very special on his hands and knew too that he needed to handle it with respect. Rahua oil was -and is- produced by the Quechua-Shuar tribe in the same complex, ritualistic, and sustainable fashion it has been for generations. Fabian, who had long worked to support the rainforest’s indigenous people, didn’t want to disrupt this process.<\/p>",
