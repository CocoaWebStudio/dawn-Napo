That’s why each Rahua product relies on plants—not chemicals—to provide a superior level of performance.<\/p><p>So many formulations on the market offer effects that don’t last and can even create new problems. Rahua doesn’t cover up—it corrects with products that deeply penetrate to leave your hair strong and shiny and your skin and scalp soothed, calmed, and restored. And because Rahua’s formulations are highly concentrated, you will use less to get superior results.<\/p>",
